            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <h3>Hey!!.. here are some of my skills</h3>
            <p>As a 17-year-old tech enthusiast and self-driven learner, 
                I enjoy building functional, user-friendly software that solves real problems.
                I have hands-on experience in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                React, along with familiarity in tools like Firebase and Git for deployment and version control.
                I’ve created several demo projects, including applications involving basic machine learning and linear regression,
                which reflect my growing interest in AI/ML and data-driven development. I also work with design tools like Figma to craft simple and intuitive user interfaces.
                While I’m not deeply into competitive problem-solving, I focus on applying what I learn to real-world projects and constantly explore new technologies to improve my skillset. My goal is to keep growing as a developer,
                build meaningful products, and eventually launch a tech startup that makes a difference.</p>
